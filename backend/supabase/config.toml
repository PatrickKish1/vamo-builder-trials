# Supabase CLI config (for db push, migration new, and optional local dev).
# See: https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli/config
#
# If you see "supabase: not found", run once (with network):  pnpm run db:install-cli
# One-time link: from backend/ run  pnpm run db:link  and pick your project + enter DB password.
# Push migrations (from backend/):  pnpm run db:push  or  node supabase/push.cjs
#   Migrations are idempotent (DROP POLICY IF EXISTS etc.) so re-run / already-applied is safe.
# New migration:   pnpm run migration:new -- my_change_name  (creates a timestamped .sql file; add your SQL there).
